# Business Model
A null capital model for the bussiness.

## Introduction
(It is learned from my case study with my friend.)
The idea is of my friend's.


## Prototype (Draft)
The prototype is a peculiar bussiness model with null capital($s). It was
developed by the author (SMW) and his friend (WHL).

```
  (Investor1)  (Investor2)   (Investor3)
     Major        Minor         Minor
    Investor     Investor      Investor
       |            |             |
       v            v             v

    Capital-1,   capital-2,    Capital-3.
      ($s)    +    ($0)     +    ($0)                        => ($s++)
       ==           \/            \/                             ^
      null,      Servant-1(#), servant-2(#), Servant-3(#)        |
                           v             v             v         |
                          ($n)     +    ($n)     +    ($n)   => $3n

                    ^              ^
                    |              |
                  Chief          Vice
                 Manager        Manager        Worker
                (Labor2)       (Labor3)       (Labor4)
```
There are three investors and three labors, but there are totally only four
persons in this company, who are invester1, invester2/labor2, invester3/labor3
and labor4.

The labor4 is a worker who has a monthly salary, say, $1,500 per month. Others
are the three investers who share the net income (netto) equally per month, say,
$5,000 each. However, the investors 2 and 3 are also labors. If the economy was
bad, they might have trouble to make their living. For example, only get $200
for each investor, or even in negative.

To solve this problem, the Intestor1(Major Investor) must have enough capital.
He/she compensates it to the other two investors to reach the same salary of
$1,500 as the worker or so. While the economy becomes better, the two minor
investors have to return $1,300 back to the major investor by the netto. It is
the general idea of this peculiar null capital bussiness model.


## Protochol
(A given timing sequence with pulses.)
(session/PI session)

## Development
The current version of this bussiness model is `v0.2.0-gamma`.
In the previous version `v0.1.0-delta`, you can only apply, employ, extend
and/or expand this model within your circule of trust for the reasons of
security and safety risks.

In this version, you can do it with your trusted third party.
